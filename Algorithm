Start

set the following variables N=0
    n=0
    m=n/N
    p=N/2

Input two numbers N=any number
      n=any number

If m=whole number then
Print "N is a divisor of n"

Otherwise Print
     "N is not a divisor of n"

Check If p=whole number
  Print "N is an even number"

If p is not a whole number
  Print "N is an odd number"

End
